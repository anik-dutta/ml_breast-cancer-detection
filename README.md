The project focuses on a prediction model to predict malignancy of breast cancer i.e. if a tumour is of malignant type or benign type based on 30 features of the cell nuclei. A dataset of 569 records that has been used for the training, test, and cross validation steps for the Learner Model by inductive learning. 

All available predictor versions are included in this model (Mean, Standard Error, and Worst) for the 15 real valued predictors (Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, 
Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity, Concave Points, Symmetry, and Fractal Dimension). A machine learning classification method has been used to fit a function that can predict the discreet class of new input features.

The dataset was collected from Kaggle.
